          <p>Carbohydrates are one of the most studied and misunderstood macronutrients. Carbs are the body’s main source of energy. There are 3 types of carbohydrates: Simple, Complex, and Fiber. Each type of carbohydrate has its benefits and uses. It is important to understand which carbohydrates your body needs.</p>
          <p>Simple sugars are a type of carbohydrate that is readily used by the body such as table sugar, Orange, juice, Cake, white bread, white rice, etc. These types of carbs are broken down quickly and used up and quickly by the body and are great to eat before a workout or right after a very difficult workout to replenish your glycogen stores. The downside to these types of carbohydrates is that the extra carbs that are ingested and not used up get turned into fat. These carbohydrates do not cause the person eating them to feel full for very long meaning they have a high glycemic index generally leading to more calories being stored as excess (2).</p>
          <p>Complex sugars are a type of carbohydrate that is used for long and sustained energy. Examples of complex sugars are whole grains, starchy vegetables like corn, peas, lima beans, potatoes, sweet potatoes, beans, oats, lentils and many more. What makes complex carbohydrates different than simple carbohydrates is how the carbohydrate is made up. Whole grains contain: bran, germ, and endosperm. The germ is the outer hard shell of the grain. It is the part of the grain that provides the most fiber and most of the B vitamins and minerals. (1) The germ is the following layer that is packed with essential fatty acids and vitamin E (1). The endosperm is the soft part of the grain that contains the nutritional value of the carbohydrate.</p>
          <p>Fiber is one of the most important carbohydrates. Fiber comes from plant foods; it is the indigestible part of plants, fruits, vegetables, and nuts. When fiber is consumed most of it passes through your intestines undigested. This helps keep you regular, and helps make you feel full and satisfied after eating. Fiber has also shown to help contribute to decreasing cholesterol and blood triglyceride panels creating a healthier cardiovascular system. Fiber is also an important nutrient in providing fuel for the bacteria in our gut. Here are some examples of foods with good dietary fiber: Apples, broccoli, Brussel sprouts, carrots, raspberries, blackberries, avocados, whole wheat pasta, oatmeal (3).</p>
          <p class="lead">Fact: Did you know that you have 10 times the amount of bacteria in your gut than cells in your body?</p>
          <p>Fiber is a natural food product for many of the bacteria that live in the gut. Increasing the amount of fiber in your diet will significant contribute to your health by stimulating and improving your immune system.</p>
          <p>On average, a normal healthy adult should consume 45-65% of their calories from carbohydrate foods. Try to pick complex carbohydrates that are high in fiber.</p>

          <p>Unlike what most people will tell you. Fats are good and many fats are healthy for us. It is important to know which fats are good and which are bad, and how to identify those. Fats should comprise 20-35% of the macronutrients for your diet. Fats are important in our diet because every cell in the human body uses fat. The membrane that surrounds each and every cell in our body is made of Fatty Acids. Fatty acids are also very important in brain and cognitive health. Lets continue to talk about the good and bad fats in our diets.</p>
          <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">The Good – Monounsaturated fats, omega 3, Polyunsaturated fats, ALA, DHA</h5>
          <p>The good fats are going to be our unsaturated fats. Unsaturated fats are liquid at room temperature. This makes the fat healthier and easier for the body to use than fats that are solid at room temperature such as animal Fats, trans fats, and saturated fats. One of the two types of healthy fats are the monounsaturated fats. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats can help reduce bad cholesterol levels in your blood which can lower your risk of heart disease and stroke. They also provide nutrients to help develop and maintain your body’s cells. (2) Another major benefit of polyunsaturated fats is that they provide essential fats that the body needs but cannot produce itself- such as omega -6 and Omega -3 fatty acids (1). The following is a small list of the benefits of healthy fats:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Lower the risk of heart disease and stroke</li>
            <li>Lower bad LDL cholesterol levels, while increasing good HDL</li>
            <li>Prevent abnormal heart rhythms</li>
            <li>Lower triglycerides associated with heart disease and fight inflammation</li>
            <li>Lower blood pressure</li>
            <li>Prevent atherosclerosis (hardening and narrowing of the arteries)</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="lead">Below is a list of the Best Sources of Omega-3’s ( 3 ):</p>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-6">
              <p style="font-weight: bold;">Non-Vegetarian Sources of Omega 3’s</p>
              <p>Fish: the best source of omega-3 (high in EPA and DHA), Anchovies, Herring, Salmon, Mackerel, Sardines, Trout, Tuna, Mussels, Oysters, Halibut.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6">
              <p style="font-weight: bold;">Vegetarian sources of omega-3s (high in ALA)</p>
              <p>Algae such as seaweed (high in EPA and DHA), Eggs (small amounts of DHA), Flaxseeds and flaxseed oil, Chia seeds, Canola and soybean oil, Walnuts, Mayonnaise, Edamame, Beans (refried, kidney, etc.), Brussels sprouts, Kale, Spinach.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">The Bad – Saturated fats & trans fats</h5>
          <p>There are two types of fat that are bad for your heart and body. The first being saturated fats. Saturated fats are commonly found in animal meat products such as bacon grease, cheese whole milk, coconut oil, and commonly found in baked goods. They are found solid at room temperature. Saturated fats should be limited to less than 10% of the day’s total caloric consumption said by the experts at Harvard Medical School. They also state that, “A diet rich in saturated fats can drive up total cholesterol and tip the balance toward more harmful LDL cholesterol levels, which promotes blockages to form in arteries in the heart and all over the body” (4).</p>
          <p>Although saturated fats aren’t the best for you and can contribute to cardiovascular problems, there is one type of fat that is much worse for you. The worst type of dietary fat is the kind known as trans fats. It is a byproduct of a process called hydrogenation that is used to turn healthy oils into solids and to prevent them from becoming rancid. The reason trans fats are so bad for you is from the process of vegetable oil being heated in the presence of a heavy metal catalyst to assist the transfer of hydrogen to the fatty carbon chain. Eating foods high in trans fats increases the amount of harmful LDL and decreased the amount of beneficial HDL cholesterol. Trans fats also create inflammation, which aids in the development of chronic conditions such as Diabetes Mellitus II, Stroke, Heart Disease. According to Harvard Medical School, “Even small amounts of trans fats can harm health: for every 2% of calories from trans fat consumed daily, the risk of heart disease rises by 23%” (4). Trans fats are primarily found in fast food frying oil because of the long shelf life and because they give a desirable taste and texture. One place to start making better choices about dietary fats would be decreasing the trips for fast food and donuts!</p>
