        <p><b>Client Results Breakdown</b></p>
        <p>“Before this client started the program she was mainly training cardiorespiratory endurance. In the first month of training with the addition of upper body and lower body muscular strength/fitness, there was a slight increase in weight due to the body converting some upper body fat into denser and leaner muscle. She has shown and continues to show significant improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness, core strength, lower body muscular endurance and upper body strength with continued training.”</p>

      <p><b>What was your fitness lifestyle like before beginning Infinite Fitness?</b></p>
      <p>Before Infinite Fitness, most of my workouts were walking either outside or on the treadmill 5 times a week and going to the sauna twice a week. It was a lot lower impact, so I was dedicated to more days a week than I needed with Infinite Fitness.</p>
      <p><b>What inspired you to make a change and workout more/ be more motivated and determined?</b></p>
      <p>Since I was doing less intense workouts, I had to do them every day in order to maintain my weight and not feel guilty about indulging in food. The repetition was getting boring, so I wanted to mix up my routine as well as cut back on days while getting healthier overall.</p>
      <p><b>What was/is the best part about training with Infinite Fitness?</b></p>
      <p>The trainers are awesome. They always have time to answer a quick text, so even though everything is done online (which is also super convenient since all my workouts are on my phone), I didn't lose the close interaction I would have received working one-on-one with a trainer. It's also nice that I don't physically have to go to the gym at all to work out.</p>
      <p><b>How has Infinite Fitness made your fitness lifestyle better?</b></p>
      <p>I've gotten stronger and more toned without even leaving my house. Other people started commenting on the amount of muscle I've gained even after the first month, so it's nice to know there's a noticeable difference that other people can tell as well since that was one of my goals. My other goal was to gain endurance, and cardio has gotten much easier for me. I've gone from walking 15-minute miles before Infinite Fitness to running 2 miles in 15 minutes after I started.</p>

      <p>“Coming from a previous athletic background he was able to improve his strength and quickly adapt to the training. We look forward to working with him and seeing his continued Improvements!”</p>

      <p><b>What was your fitness lifestyle like before beginning Infinite Fitness?</b></p>
      <p>I used to be a gymnast at OU, but I began dental school and found myself not having enough time to workout. I would get to a gym about 1-2 a week.</p>
      <p><b>What inspired you to make a change and workout more/ be more motivated and determined?</b></p>
      <p>I found myself feeling more tired and depressed and attributed it to my lack of exercise.</p>
      <p><b>What was/is the best part about training with Infinite Fitness?</b></p>
      <p>The best part is that I feel like I have someone keeping me accountable for each workout. I am motivated to workout as I get the workout plan each morning. It is also the benefit of having a personal trainer without the cost of one. I am easily able to have a workout plan each day with a video and tips on how to do it correctly.</p>
      <p><b>How has Infinite Fitness made your fitness lifestyle better?</b></p>
      <p>I am now consistently working it 4 times a week as well as improving the efficiency of my workouts. I feel like I am getting a lot more of a workout in only an hour period. This allows me to still squeeze a workout in my very busy schedule as a dental student.</p>

      <p><b>Client Results Breakdown</b></p>
      <p>“Client has shown a steady decrease in weight and overall BMI each month. There is significant improvement in their cardiorespiratory fitness as shown by the increase in VO2 and large decrease in Resting Heart Rate. Also noted are steady increases in upper body fitness as shown by the large increase in Max Push ups, and overall increase in Leg wall sit.”</p>
      <p>“For a client who is 42 years old, they have shown increases in their relative VO2 and Upper Body Strength; two things in which normally decline with age we were able to help show improvements turning back the body’s biological clock. VO2 is important because it tells us the correlation between cardiorespiratory fitness and functional capacity of the heart.”</p>

      <p><b>What was your fitness lifestyle like before beginning Infinite Fitness?</b></p>
      <p>Sitting on couch binge watching Netflix every evening & eating everything but veggies.</p>
      <p><b>What inspired you to make a change and workout more/ be more motivated and determined?</b></p>
      <p>I was embarrassed by how I looked. Tired of feeling tired & not being involved with my kids.</p>
      <p><b>What was/is the best part about training with Infinite Fitness?</b></p>
      <p>I can do it privately in my home. The workouts are challenging but I can do them! They increase just enough each week to see/feel growth. They mix it to keep it fun.</p>
      <p><b>How has Infinite Fitness made your fitness lifestyle better?</b></p>
      <p>I want to go for walks every evening. I look forward to getting my workouts & doing them. I’m even starting to jog a bit! It makes me want to eat healthier also so I feel good to workout.</p>
