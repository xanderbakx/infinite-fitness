        <p class="text-justify">I specialize in total bodyweight training to strengthen the core and increase the functional ability of the body for anyone who is in the initial stages of working out again. I use gymnastics based bodyweight training that allows anyone to consistently improve on strength, flexibility, and balance. My background as an All-Around NAIGC National Champion gymnast, degree in Health and Exercise Science, personal trainer, and experience in collegiate sports performance has allowed me to pursue my passion of creating and developing a comprehensive fitness program that consistently keeps you on track and progressing through and beyond your goals. My mission at Infinite Fitness is to increase the health and wellness of others by teaching about the overall importance and benefits of a continued exercise program, provide accountability coaching, results tracking, and to help YOU live a healthier lifestyle through a consistent, progressive, easy to follow program.</p>

        <p class="gray lead text-center">ACSM Certified Trainer</p>
        <p class="text-justify">Call me Trainer Will! I am passionate about High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) Programs to strengthen both the body and mind. My workout regimen consists of strengthening the core and improving the neural and functional aspects of exercise. I like to utilize the HIIT training style of boxing conditioning with the fundamentals of gymnastics conditioning; including strength, flexibility, balance, and coordination. I competed as a Division 1 NCAA athlete winning an individual All-American award in 2014 as well as a team National Championship in 2015, while earning a degree in Health Sciences. Shortly after completing my bachelors degree I became an ACSM Certified Personal Trainer and have begun working in Emergency Medicine as an EMT/Nursing Student. I believe that incorporating a comprehensive exercise program into your life can benefit you both in your physical and psychological health. I am here to provide you with accountability coaching, fitness tracking, and guided exercise. My mission at Infinite Fitness is to improve the life of my clients by pushing and motivating them to become the best version of themselves that they can be!</p>
